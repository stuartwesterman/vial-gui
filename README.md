Python 3.8+ is required (tested with Python 3.13). This version uses PyQt6 and modern PyInstaller instead of the deprecated fbs.

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To launch the application afterwards:

```
source venv/bin/activate
python run.py
```

To build a standalone executable:

```
source venv/bin/activate
python build.py
```

To clean build artifacts:

```
python build.py clean
```
